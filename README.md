The project aims to create an educational forum that integrates cloud storage and wiki concept, allowing
students to access study materials as well as filter through and favorite them. Students can also browse lecture
and lab notes and access to past course materials, professor ratings, and difficulty ratings for past exams.
Students can generate summary notes from uploaded materials and receive a guided walkthrough upon
registration. The StudHub forum provides a comprehensive platform for students to enhance their learning
experience.
